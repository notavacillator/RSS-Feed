Bash
cd react-app
npm run build

This will create an optimized production build in the build folder within the react-app directory.
2.  Deploy the contents of the express-server folder (along with the build folder from the react-app directory if applicable) to your chosen hosting platform.
3.  Configure the Express server to serve the built React application from the appropriate directory (usually the build folder within the express-server directory).

Further Considerations

For a more robust deployment process, consider using a CI/CD pipeline to automate building and deploying the application.
Make sure to configure environment variables for sensitive information like database credentials or API keys. These should not be included in your version control system.
